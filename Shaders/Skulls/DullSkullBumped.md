Another great skull shader by Kris Katur. To make the shader visible, a cube map is required, which must be connected to the first input (iChannel0) of the Fuse. The second input is a noise texture that distorts parts of the object. A noise texture should be adjusted using a downstream blur node to prevent excessive surface distortion.

Have fun playing!
