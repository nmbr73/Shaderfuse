Converting this was a lot of fun again.

I've added many parameters. The colors of the UFO, the path, and the surroundings can be customized.

The mouse parameter allows you to change the flight altitude and lateral offset (the landscape adjusts accordingly).

Many view parameters allow you to control the camera, especially the camera movements (pans), which also allows you to look behind you.

Have fun playing!
