A cool shader with a wide range of parameters for playing. I've taken various color combinations from the shader "Perhaps a screensaver" (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Wfy3zh). This shader is identical except for the variations—its origin is unclear.

Enjoy playing!

A bit of Saturday coding (also Norway’s Constitution Day).
Some artifacts remain, but it’s good enough for my standards.
