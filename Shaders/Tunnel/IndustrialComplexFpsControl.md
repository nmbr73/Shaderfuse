A great shader. Keyboard input is emulated via checkboxes: forward, backward, left, right, jump, sprint, and crawl. There are three options: Details, Glowing Fog, and Special Lighting. And there are other parameters as well. You can change the viewing direction with the mouse.

Have fun playing!

### Description of the Shader in Shadertoy:
I learned more from Shanes' Industrial Complex than any other, simply due to my obsession with how it worked as I was starting GLSL. During that time, the thing I wanted most was to explore if first person. Well... now I can, and so can you!
