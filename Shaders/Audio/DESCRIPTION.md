Shaders that use audio data (wave and frequency) over an image for display. Shadertoy provides an interface consisting of an image (512*2 pixels). One line contains 512 sampled waveform values ​​belonging to the current frame and the second line contains the FFT (Spectrum) values.
This interface can also be implemented in Resolve/Fusion. The [AudioWaveform.fuse](https://github.com/nmbr73/Shaderfuse/blob/main/Fuses/AudioWaveform.md) generates the corresponding image from a loaded WAV file. The AudioWaveform has a second output for this. This Output is connected to an AudioShaderfuse-Input.
