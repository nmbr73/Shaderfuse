# FractalRadioBase.fuse :new:

Based on '_[FractalRadioBase](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WlcczS)_' by [gaz](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Kali) and ported by [JiPi](../Site/Profiles/JiPi.md).

An alien antenna hovers through the universe. So far only a few parameters are available.
In the original, very nice details were added via BufferA, but this has been omitted here in the conversion.
