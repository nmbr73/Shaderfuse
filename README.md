[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/nmbr73/Shaderfuse?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/nmbr73/Shaderfuse/releases/latest) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-various-critical)](LICENSE) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/793508729785155594?label=discord)](https://discord.gg/Zb48E4z3Pg)

[Shadertoy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com/) fragment shaders converted to Fuses for use in DaFusion (this is either the stand alone version of Fusion or DaVinci Resolve's Fusion page) on Mac or Windows. If you are a software dev interested in contributing to the Shaderfuse project, then you've come to the right place. If you are more of a digital artist mainly wanting to just use the Fuses in BMD's DaFusion, then it's recommended that you start your journey at [nmbr73.github.io/Shaderfuse/](https://nmbr73.github.io/Shaderfuse/). And if you don't know what all of this is about, then you may want to have a look at our [Shaderfuse video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbIsaWc6bt1AuwEHF116QcFsNPKnLYHD) first to get an idea.



# Installation

Make sure to read, understand and respect the [LICENSE](LICENSE) information: As we do run some shady scripts that make changes to your system you need to know that in particular absolutely no warranties are made and all of this is completely at your own risk!

First `cd` into a directory where the project can permanently reside. Some links will be created pointing into this directory to make it work with your DaFusion installation; therefore its location can not easily be changed later. Checkout the whole repository ...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmbr73/Shaderfuse.git
```
Then use your systems file manager (*File Explorer* on Windows, resp. *Finder* on a Mac) to Drag'n'drop the `Tools/Setup.lua` onto your Fusion's working area. Select *'Use Fuses under Shaders straight out of the repository'*. Save this setting and restart the application. See [Setup](Tools/README.md) for further information on what this Lua scripts tries to do behind the scenes.

Now you should be ready to play with the code and try it in DaFusion. Also you can now follow along the latest developments with a simple `git pull`.

If you want to track your own changes and maybe even contribute them via pull requests, then you should do all of the above on your own fork of the [Shaderfuses](https://github.com/nmbr73/Shaderfuse) project (highly recommended; works pretty much the same; just replace `nmbr73` with your GitHub user name).



# Local Build

In case you want to build the documentation locally, and/or to test the Reactor Atom package build, then do the following (Mac only at the moment; and even more fragile than the normal installation already is). Note: Some of this functionality should also be accessible from within DaFusion via the [Repository Tools](Tools/Scripts/Comp/Shaderfuse/Repository%20Tools/README.md), but the 'build.sh' script is in the end what's being used in the Action workflows on GitHub.

Be sure to have Lua installed and make the `build.sh` script executable ...
```bash
brew install lua
cd Shaderfuse
chmod +x ./build.sh
```

Then a `./build.sh help` should show you the available options as something like:
```
Usage:

  build.sh <command>

The commands are:

  atom         create the atom package under 'atom/'
  csv          create Shaders.csv with a list of all the shaders
  assets       create 'assets/' with files to add to a GitHub release
  installers   create the drag'n'drop installer lua scripts
  docs         create all the input needed for mkdocs
  clean        delete any of the autogenerated / temporary content
```

If you also want to render and view the documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), then install its dependencies into a virtual Python environment:
```bash
cd Shaderfuse
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs-callouts
pip install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
```

This should then allow you to build and serve the documentation on your computer:
```bash
cd Shaderfuse
source venv/bin/activate
./build.sh docs
mkdocs serve
```

This code is mainly based on the work of **Chris Ridings** and his *[Guide to Writing Fuses for Resolve/fusion](https://www.chrisridings.com/guide-to-writing-fuses-for-resolve-fusion-part-1/)* and the [FragmentShader.fuse](https://www.chrisridings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FragmentShader.fuse) from his *[Davinci Resolve Page Curl Transition](https://www.chrisridings.com/page-curl/)* article; **Bryan Ray**, who did a whole series of blog posts on *[OpenCL Fuses](http://www.bryanray.name/wordpress/opencl-fuses-index/)*; **JiPi**, who did an excellent 'We Suck Less' post on how to *[Convert a Shadertoy WebGL Code to DCTL](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4460)* accompanied by a (German) [DCTL Tutorial](https://youtu.be/dbrPWRldmbs) video. As an introduction and if you want to know more about shaders in general, a look into *[The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com)* is highly recommended. Again the [We Suck Less](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/index.php) forum is the place where you will find tons of information and all the experts. A big *thank you!!!* must go to **Andrew Hazelden** for all his exceptional support and for his everlasting commitment to the stimulation of the Fusion development community. And last but not least one must note that in the end all these fuses are based on the remarkable work shared by those wonderful people out there on **[Shadertoy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com/)**.
